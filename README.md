Rak is a real-time hybrid path tracing engine written in C++. It currently uses OpenGL for rendering. Currently uses a SAH BVH as the acceleration structure.

Rak uses SFML for window setup and texture loading, assimp for model loading, glm for general maths and a modified version of sfml imgui. 

The repo for sfml imgui can be found [here](https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml)

# Rak current version - 0.1a
Rak is currently **not** ready for any production (or even hobby) use. Rak is **seriously** lacking features and is in a **very** early stage of development. Thus, there will be no releases for this and many upcomming versions. There is no date for the first Rak release promised, as it is hard to estimate how long some of these features will take to implement. 

# New with Rak 0.1a
  - Completely new Material Creator, allowing for *3* material types. These are, *premade material*, *custom lambert material* and *Custom emmisive material* 
  - Minor bug fixes
# Planned for Rak 0.2a 
  - Saving and loading rak scenes. 
  - Proper camera 
  - More settings from gui 
# Planned for further Rak versions in the future 
  - Point lights and spot lights 
  - Better directional shadows 
  - Translation, rotation and scale of models
  - Proper importing of models 
  - Way, way more premade materials 
  - 2 new material types (*Refractive material* and *Translucent material*) 
  - Proper documentation (both via github but also in the program itself
  - And way, way more!
