Rak is a real-time hybrid path tracing engine written in C++. It currently uses OpenGL for rendering. Currently uses a SAH BVH as the acceleration structure.

Rak uses SFML for window setup and texture loading, assimp for model loading, glm for general maths and a modified version of sfml imgui. 

The repo for sfml imgui can be found [here](https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml)
